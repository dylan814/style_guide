# The SASS style guide project
These files are a part of Dylan Pereira's submission for Treehouse's Front-End Web Development Techdegree project "Web Style Guide". 

This project involves the use of Sass, the CSS preprocessor, to demonstrate skill in this popular means of writing scalable CSS.

The media query breakpoints used in this project follow the recommendations in the Free Code Camp article "The 100% correct way to do CSS breakpoints" found at: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-100-correct-way-to-do-css-breakpoints-88d6a5ba1862. However, the "xs" and "sm" breakpoint values were modified to be consistent with the web copy for this project (768px and 769px respectively).

- Site was tested in Chrome for Mac, Firefox for Mac, and Apple Safari.
- HTML validated via the W3C Markup Validation Service.
- CSS validated via the W3C CSS Validation Service.
